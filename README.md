Tokyo Chill
===========

Tokyo Chill is a relaxing site, built using HTML, JavaScript and SASS, that provides a view of the world on a rainy day.
The website streams music live from SoundCloud, allowing you to chill out while watching rain drops fall on your screen.

The website is built using the following technologies:
- [RainyDay.js](https://github.com/maroslaw/rainyday.js) by Marek Brodziak (Used for the JavaScript rain effect)
- [Textillate](https://github.com/jschr/textillate) by Jordan Schroter (Used for text animations)
- [DanEden's Sweet CSS](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) by Daniel Eden (For color effects and general awesomeness)
